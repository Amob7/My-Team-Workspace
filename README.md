# My-Team-Workspace

## Description

I am on a software engineering team and wanted to implement a tool to create a workspace for a team that the user inputs into a given system. This program uses the Employee class and has subclasses falling off of it. It also runs with tests.

This is a fully functioning user input program. You decide whether you want to add a teammate. If the user chooses Y then you are taken to another prompt which will ask what role the teammate is. Based on the teammate the user will be asked to input different values. All roles will be asked to give their name, email, and have a personal id. Engineers will be asked to give their github username. Interns will be asked to give their School names. Managers will be asked to give their Office Number. These values will be appended to the index.html file in proper format. After appending that file the user will be asked whether or not they want to add another teammate. If Y than they are taken back to the prompts

When the user selects the n option, they will be given a console log if the file is properly finished appending, or an error if not. Once the file is appended the user may see thier proper team workspace.
